/**
 * Additional styles applied only to the WordPress editor
 *
 * It is sometimes necessary to add additional styles for the WordPress block
 * editor, generally to improve the editor experience. For example, you may
 * want to tweak the appearance of the title area to better match your siteâ€™s
 * front end, or you may need to change the appearance of a block to better
 * distinguish between its fields while editing.
 *
 * Those styles should be added in this file, and they will be added only to
 * the block editor.
